      <h1>Jerome Philip Ortega</h1>
      <p>Hi there!  Welcome to my portfolio.  I am a current coding padawan, and I really enjoy doing numerous coding experiments, even with my knowledge of various languages and coding concepts being very limited.  I am currently enjoying all the coursework at Coding Dojo, and it seems to only get more interesting and fun as time goes on.  I'm very excited to see what comes!  I am married to the most wonderful woman in the universe, and my hobbies include videogames, computers, and video production!</p>
